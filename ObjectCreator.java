 * NAME: SHAYNE MUJURU

 * TITLE: CPSC501 A3 : OBJECT CREATOR
 * DESCRIPTION : 
 * 
 * This part of your system will create arbitrary objects under control of the user. 
 * Allow the user to create one or more objects from a selection of objects using some sort of text-based menu system or GUI. 
 * You must demonstrate that your system can handle the following kinds of objects:
 * 
 *      A simple object with only primitives for instance variables. 
 * The user of your program must also beable to set the values for these fields.
 *      An object that contains references to other objects. 
 * Of course, these other objects must also be created at the same time, and their primitive instance variables must be settable by the user. 
 * Your program must also be able to deal with circular references (i.e. objects connected in a graph).
 *      An object that contains an array of primitives. 
 * Allow the user to set the values for the array elements to arbitrary values.
 *      An object that contains an array of object references. 
 * The other objects must also be created at the same time.
 *      An object that uses an instance of one of Java’s collection classes to refer to several other objects. These objects, too, must be created at the same time.
